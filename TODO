SimpleGameUI: damage effect, action indicator, timeout indicator

CommonUI:
GameHallScreen,
ARTWORKS!


bug:
UI can get the action_apply message before the action applies,
if UI thread first runs, it can't get needed data (or worse -- crashes).

both action_apply and action_after event will be needed for ui.



Core:
chat,
user subsystem,
error reporting subsystem
    * server auto restart
auto upgrade subsystem


and finally, the game!
